Benpro.fr
================

Welcome here! This is a tiny website, used to inventory some of my
works/contribs/contents.

I'm Benoît.S a.k.a Benpro, a french boy, 25 years old, Geek/Hacker sysadmin by
day at [Evolix](http://evolix.fr "French IT Opensource company") and Otaku by
night.  I'm passionate about the world of free software and Japanese culture.

If you want to contact me, go ahead, my mail is benpro＠benpro⊙fr. You can also
find me on Freenode IRC Network, idling somewhere on multiple channels (/whois
benpro).
