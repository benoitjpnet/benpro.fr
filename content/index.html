Benpro's Network
================

Welcome here! This is a tiny website like a portfolio.

I'm Benoît.S a.k.a Benpro, a french boy, 23 years old, Geek sysadmin by day
at [Evolix](http://evolix.fr "French IT Opensource company") and Otaku by
night. I'm passionate about the world of free software and
Japanese culture.

If you want to contact me, go ahead, my mail is benpro＠benpro⊙fr. You can also
find me on Freenode IRC Network, idling somewhere on multiple channels 
(/whois benpro).
